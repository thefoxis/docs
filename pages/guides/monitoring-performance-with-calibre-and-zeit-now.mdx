[Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) is a comprehensive monitoring platform that makes it easy to uncover and address performance issues. In this guide, you will learn how to receive performance [Pull Request Reviews](https://calibreapp.com/pull-request-reviews) directly in your pull requests following [ZEIT Deployment Previews](https://zeit.co/features/deployment-previews).

## Step 1: Deploy with ZEIT Now

To deploy your project with the [ZEIT Now for GitHub Integration](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github), make sure your created project has been pushed to a Git repository.

[Import the project](/new) into ZEIT Now from GitHub:

<List columnsDesktop={3} columnsTablet={3} columnsMobile={1}>
  <IconCard label="GitHub" icon={<GitHubIcon />} href="/new?tab=github" plus />
</List>

After your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview), and all changes made to the default branch (commonly `master`) will result in a [Production Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production).

<Note type="warning">
  While ZEIT Now supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, Calibre Pull Request
  Reviews currently work with ZEIT and GitHub only. GitLab and Bitbucket are not
  supported.
</Note>

## Step 2: Add Your Site to Calibre

To receive performance metrics and reports, start by [creating a Calibre account](https://calibreapp.com/sign-up) and adding sites to monitor. You will be prompted to add a name, provide a URL, choose from 14 global test locations, and set a testing schedule.

Calibre allows you to **check unlimited sites and pages**. Each site can be connected to a repository to receive Pull Request Reviews.

If you’d like to learn more about how to successfully set up a performance monitoring system, read the Calibre [Getting Started](https://calibreapp.com/docs/get-started/guide) guide.

## Step 3: Connect Calibre to GitHub

To enable Pull Request Reviews, from the Calibre Dashboard, go to **Site → Settings → Integrations** tab and click **Install** next to the GitHub logo. You will be redirected to GitHub to enable the integration for your organization.

<Note type="success" label="hint">
  Calibre requires access to commit statuses, deployments, checks, and pull
  requests. We strongly recommend only granting access to selected repositories
  you’re interested in tracking.
</Note>

### Select a Comparison Branch

After confirming the link between GitHub and Calibre, you will have to select a primary branch that will be the base for performance comparisons. This branch should be either deploying to production or a staging environment. In most cases, this might be the `master` branch.

<Note type="success" label="hint">
  For the most accurate results, 
  <strong>make sure you compare two very similar environments</strong>. Some of the
  common differentiators producing unreliable results can be using a CDN on production,
  but not on Pull Request deployments, or the presence of ads or other third parties.
</Note>

When the selected branch is successfully deployed, Calibre [creates a deployment marker](https://calibreapp.com/docs/get-started/deploys) on your charts and takes a new snapshot of your site. That way, you always know how releases affect your performance metrics.

### Create a Pull Request

Calibre will compare each Pull Request to the median of your site metrics since the last deploy. Each report highlights critical measurements (Lighthouse Performance Score, Time to Interactive and First Contentful Paint) overall and across [Test Profiles](https://calibreapp.com/test-profiles) to highlight top-level changes.

You can analyse each page to see browser previews for specific Test Profiles and most significant changes, including any [Performance Budgets](https://calibreapp.com/performance-budgets) that have changed.

Performance metrics highlighted in Pull Request Reviews can be customised in `/.calibre/config.yml`. Find out more about [configuration options](https://calibreapp.com/docs/features/pull-request-reviews#configure-metrics).
